# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Natural Language DEX Interface with ElizaOS

### **Project Overview**
A conversational AI agent built on ElizaOS that enables users to interact with a specific DEX across Pulsechain, Base Chain, and Sonic Chain through natural language commands. The system will auto-generate secure wallets for users and provide comprehensive trading, liquidity management, and analytics capabilities.
