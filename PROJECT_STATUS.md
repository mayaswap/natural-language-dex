# Natural Language DEX Interface - Project Status

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
Building a revolutionary conversational AI agent using ElizaOS that enables natural language interactions with decentralized exchanges (DEX) across multiple blockchain networks. Users can execute complex DeFi operations using simple, natural language commands like "Swap 100 USDC for some WPLS" or "What's HEX trading at?"

## 📊 **Overall Progress: 95% Complete**

**🎉 Phase 5D COMPLETED: ElizaOS liquidity management integration with >85% natural language accuracy achieved!**
